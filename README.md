# All_functions
all my functions;
you see, i took 2 days in doing a lot of things i love to do on python many thing.
While i use dictionaries, lists, sets and tuples i'm very happy.
This file contains a lot of different types of functions. many of them need dictionaries, or something else.
But i've made it easy for you.
### Thanks for using my repository(again)
